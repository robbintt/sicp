##### Chapter 1:

I read each section, then completed its problems.  Sometimes I read ahead.

After each problem set required myself to go back to the next subsequent section and re-read through to the next problem set. During this final read, I typed and ran all examples. In this way, I read most of the chapter 2-4 times.

I worked linearly on each exercise until I solved it. 

I never referred to external sources to arrive at my answer. 

Incorrect answers were discovered by observing Bill The Lizard's work. They are rare and annotated as such.

I only received 'hints' by observing the correct answer after failing. I did not observe any intermediate work at any time.


- `examples` - all book examples typed with supporting code
- `exercises` - all exercises completed with annotations
