##### Chapter 1:

I read each section, then completed its problems. I allowed myself to read ahead but after each problem set required myself to go back to the next subsequent section and re-read through to the next problem set. In this way, I read most of the chapter 2-4 times.

In the examples directory, I copied code from the book examples and ran it. Sometimes this required copying some supporting code from previous sections.

In the exercises directory, I worked on every exercise until I solved it. I never referred to external sources to find an answer. I rarely had the wrong answer and only discovered that when checking my answer against Bill the Lizard. These wrong answers should be annotated for the most part. When checking answers, I covered Bill's intermediate work. Obviously I ended up with a hint when observing the correct answer for those cases in which I missed it on the first try. I did not use Bill's intermediate work to solve any problem.
