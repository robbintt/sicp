##### Chapter 1:

I read through each section, then completed its problems.  Sometimes I read further ahead.

After each problem set, I required myself to go backwards to the subsequent section from my last completed exercise. I then re-read to the next problem while typing/running all examples. 

In this way, I read each section 2-4 times.

I worked linearly on each exercise until I solved it. 

I never referred to external sources to arrive at my answer. 

Incorrect answers were discovered by observing Bill The Lizard's work. They are rare and annotated as such.

I only received 'hints' by observing the correct answer after failing. I did not observe any intermediate work at any time.


- `examples` - all book examples typed with supporting code
- `exercises` - all exercises completed with annotations
