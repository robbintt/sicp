### Chapter 1

##### Rules / Cadence
- I stepped through the chapter linearly, completing problems in order.
- After each problem set, I moved the 'reading pointer' backwards to the section subsequent to the last completed exercise. I then read forwards to the next problem while typing/running all examples. 
- In this way, I read each section 2-4 times.
- I never used external sources or techniques not referenced in the preceding text to solve a problem.
- Incorrect answers were discovered by observing Bill The Lizard's answers. They are rare and annotated as such.
- I received 'hints' by observing the correct answer after failing, very rarely the intermediate work. I believe I did have to refer to intermediate work once.


##### Structure
- `examples` - all book examples typed with supporting code
- `exercises` - all exercises completed with annotations

##### Notes
- Alias: `scm -> mit-scheme` in my local environment / dotfiles.
- The package/interpreter in debian/ubuntu 14.04 is mit-scheme
- Load a file as stdin (in bash terminal) with `$ scm < my_filename.scm`
